# GDUtilities

A collection of util scripts that fits my development needs.

## Auto Scroller

The `auto scroller` watches the attached `scroll container`, and makes its content do ping-pong action automatically when exceeds the size of the viewport, this is an easy and design-wise cheap way for addressing UI overflow issues when dealing with the situation when the text becomes larger than it was when designing the UI. This script also disables user interactions for the controlled `scroll container`.
